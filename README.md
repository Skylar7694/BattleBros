# BattleBros
 Final project CSC303

This will be a turn-based fighting game like Pok√©mon

The win condition will be beat 3 enemies
The lose condition will be have your HP dropped to zero. 

The player will walk around the area until they come across enemies that have been randomly generated. 

The game will have a map character and enemy sprites and combat logic.
Realistically I think this game will be a test run for the game that I am wanting to make. I think I will be able to get the logic of the game down and be able to walk around and randomly generate invisible enemies on the map that show up after they are encountered. I think I will be able to make the battle system and have it so there are win and lose conditions. I would like to maybe put in a menu feature if I have time however I do not expect to have enough time to get to it.
